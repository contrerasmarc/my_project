# My Project that shares a unique theme for my apps

A very basic [Sproutcore](http://www.github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore) app that shows how sharing a theme for several apps in your project.

Note: YOU MUST INCLUDE MANDATORILY FOR EACH SLICE THE TOP, LEFT, WIDTH AND HEIGHT PARAMETERS
This will avoid to make mistakes to Chance (SproutCore's CSS Framework)
